## Description

This is my portfolio page showcasing my skills, the software projects I've realized so far as well as my contact details.

## Why I built this site

First and foremost, I built this site for showcasing my software projects. Building this site was also a good practice for transforming a figma mockup which had been designed by someone else into code. I did my best applying clean code principles and clean architecture while building this app

## Tech Stack
- Javascript ES6
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- Tailwind Styled Components

## Features
- responsive design
- animated hamburger menu
- dynamic sidebar
- animation of elements depending on scroll position

## How to install and run the project

1) Clone the project, running git **clone https://https://github.com/Larence0401/Portfolio-Site**

2) Install dependencies running **npm i** or **yarn add** in your terminal

3) Run **npm start** or **yarn run dev** in your terminal

## How to use the project

Some ideas for additional feature you could add to the app:

- the user can select between several topographical maps
- route building for hikes and cycling tours on each stop
- more detailed info an accommodations provided by Google Places Api
- the user can add flights to the trip

## Deploy on Vercel
